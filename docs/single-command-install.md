# Single-Command Installation Guide

This document provides comprehensive instructions for the quick, single-command installation of the EDA Server Operator. Also covered are additional details such as prerequisites, uninstallation, and troubleshooting tips.

## Prerequisites
Before proceeding with the installation, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

1. **Kubernetes Cluster**: You need an active Kubernetes cluster. If you do not have one, you can set it up using platforms like Minikube, Kind, or a cloud provider like AWS, Azure, or GCP.

2. **kubectl**: The Kubernetes command-line tool, kubectl, should be installed and configured to communicate with your cluster. You can check its availability by running `kubectl version`.

## Installation
The EDA Server Operator can be installed using a single command. This command applies a YAML file from the EDA Server Operator's GitHub repository directly to your Kubernetes cluster.

Run the following command in your terminal to install the latest operator

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/ansible/eda-server-operator/releases/latest/download/operator.yaml
```

If you want to install a specific version instead, modify the version to whichever version you want to install. For example:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/ansible/eda-server-operator/releases/download/1.0.0/operator.yaml
```

> [!Note]
> This will create the EDA Server Operator resources in the eda-server-operator-system namespace.

Now create your EDA custom resource by applying the `eda-demo.yml` file and you will soon have a working EDA instance!

```yaml
# eda-demo.yaml
apiVersion: eda.ansible.com/v1alpha1
kind: EDA
metadata:
  name: my-eda
spec:
  automation_server_url: https://awx-host
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f eda-demo.yaml
```

See the [README.md](../README.md) for more information on configuring EDA by modifying the `spec`.

## Upgrading

## Pre-Upgrade Checklist

* **Backup**: Backup your EDA instance by creating an EDABackup. 
* **Review Release Notes**: Check the release notes for the new version of the EDA Server Operator. This can be found on the GitHub [releases page](https://github.com/ansible/eda-server-operator/releases). Pay attention to any breaking changes, new features, or specific instructions for upgrading from your current version.

### Upgrade the Operator

Check the [Releases Page](https://github.com/ansible/eda-server-operator/releases) for the latest EDA Server Operator verion. Copy the URL to the `operator.yaml` artifact for it, then apply it.

For example, if upgrading to version 1.1.0, the command would be:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/ansible/eda-server-operator/releases/download/1.1.0/operator.yaml
``````

Monitor the upgrade process by checking the status of the pods in the eda-server-operator-system namespace. You can use the following command:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n eda-server-operator-system
```


## Cleanup
If you wish to remove the EDA Server Operator from your Kubernetes cluster, follow these steps:

Run the following command:

```bash
kubectl delete -f https://github.com/ansible/eda-server-operator/releases/download/1.0.0/operator.yaml
```
