                            is less than 5(MinDomains), so \"global minimum\" is treated
                            as 0. In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector
                            cannot be scheduled, because computed skew will be 3(3

                            as 0. In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector
                            cannot be scheduled, because computed skew will be 3(3

                            it will violate MaxSkew. \n This is a beta field and requires

                            is less than 5(MinDomains), so \"global minimum\" is treated
                            as 0. In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector
                            cannot be scheduled, because computed skew will be 3(3

                            as 0. In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector
                            cannot be scheduled, because computed skew will be 3(3

                            As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less
                            than minDomains, scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew
                            Pods to those domains. If value is nil, the constraint
                            behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1. Valid values are
                            integers greater than 0. When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable
                            must be DoNotSchedule. \n For example, in a 3-zone cluster,
                            MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with
                            the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/2: | zone1 | zone2
                            | zone3 | |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  | The number of domains
                            is less than 5(MinDomains), so \"global minimum\" is treated
                            as 0. In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector
                            cannot be scheduled, because computed skew will be 3(3
                            - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                            it will violate MaxSkew. \n This is a beta field and requires
                            the MinDomainsInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled
                            (enabled by default)."

                            as 0. In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector
                            cannot be scheduled, because computed skew will be 3(3
